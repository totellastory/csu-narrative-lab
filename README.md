# 🎭 CSU Narrative Lab: The Universal Dramaturg

**A specialized AI tool for stress-testing fictional characters using the principles of dramatic theory.**

## 📖 Overview
The **Narrative Lab** is a "Flight Simulator" for screenwriters. Instead of using AI to generate generic stories, this tool uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as a ruthless **Dramaturg**. 

It forces the writer to define the deep structure of a character (Goal, Hidden Truth, Inner Need) and then tests that structure against established storytelling frameworks (e.g., McKee, Aristotle, Egri).

## 🚀 Key Features
* **The Dramaturg's Assessment:** Ingests a specific rulebook (uploaded by the user) to grade the character's narrative potential.
* **The Conflict Test (Duel):** Simulates a dialogue scene between the protagonist and an antagonist to test if the conflict creates genuine drama.
* **The Interrogation:** A chat interface where the user can interview the character to test the consistency of their "Hidden Truth."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Python)
* **Model:** Google Gemini Flash 1.5
* **Concept:** Context Engineering & RAG-Lite (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## 🔗 Live Demo
This tool is currently deployed for the **CSU Summit Workshop**.
